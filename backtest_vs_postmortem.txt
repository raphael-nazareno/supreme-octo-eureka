1. Backtest – “What would have happened if I traded like this?”

Think: simulation of a strategy on recent data.

- Weekly 7-day backtest might do:
- Take your model + a candidate policy
(e.g. “go long if p_up > 0.55, size = 1%, TP/SL = X/Y”).
- Replay the last 7 days bar-by-bar, in time order.
- At each bar:
  - Compute features.
  - Ask the model for predictions.
  - Apply the policy to decide LONG / SHORT / FLAT.
  - Update virtual positions and P&L.

Outputs are things like:

- Total P&L over those 7 days
- Sharpe / max drawdown
- Win rate, avg win / avg loss
- Trade count, exposure, etc.
- Per-coin breakdown (BTC/ETH/SOL)

You use this to answer:

- “Is this strategy variant any good on recent data?”
- “What if I tighten TP/SL, or adjust thresholds?”
- “Is the model still behaving reasonably, or has edge decayed?”

Backtest is hypothetical – it doesn’t care what you actually did last week, only what you would have done under a specific rule set.





2. Post-mortem – “Given what I actually did, what went right/wrong?”

Think: autopsy on real (or paper) trades / decisions.

Weekly 7-day post-mortem might:

- Take your real trade log or “decisions log” for the last 7 days:
  - timestamps
  - features at decision time
  - model outputs (p_up, etc)
  - action taken (long/short/flat, size)
  - realized P&L for each trade
- Join that with market data to reconstruct:
  - what the alternative outcomes would have been (e.g. if you stayed flat, or sized differently)
- Slice & analyse:

Examples of questions:

- Model quality
  - When model said p_up > 0.6, how often was it actually right?
  - Are big-confidence trades actually more profitable than low-confidence ones (calibration)?
- Strategy quality
  - Did we exit too early? Too late?
  - Are we trading too much in noisy periods (e.g. overnight chop)?
- Operational issues
  - Any missed signals?
  - Latency / slippage outliers?
  - Bugs in order sizing/routing?

So: post-mortem is about understanding and improving behaviour of:
- the model
- the policy
- and the “plumbing” (execution, risk, etc.)

Using what actually happened last week, not just a hypothetical run.
